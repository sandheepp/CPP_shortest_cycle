   1.  Fix some node u.
   2.  Run Dijkstra's algorithm with source u, denote the distance of a vertex v to u as dv. 
       If you store parents, this will give you a shortest-path tree rooted at u.
   3.  Preprocess the tree for LCA queries.

   or

   You can store for each node the first node you saw on the shortest path to that node 
   other than u with a small modification to Dijkstra's, 
   and then check if those values are different instead of checking that the LCA is u.
    
    4. Consider some edge e = {v, x} that is not in the shortest-path tree. 
    If lca(v, x) = u, then the path is a simple cycle containing u, 
    with weight dv + dx + w(e). The answer for vertex u is the minimum weight over all such cycles.
